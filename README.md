1.	In sliding puzzle, it consists of a 3x3 grid with eight numbered tiles and one empty space.

3.	Solve the given problem using python. Consider a Water Jug problem: You are given two jugs, a 4-gallon one and a 3-gallon one. Neither has any measuring marker on it. There is a pump that can be used to fill the jugs with water. How can you get exactly 2 gallons of water into the 4-gallon jug?  Explicit Assumptions: A jug can be filled from the pump, water can be poured out of a jug onto the ground, water can be poured from one jug to another and that there are no other measuring devices available.
4.	Given an array of strings, arr[] of size N and a string S, the task is to find if it is possible to map integers value in the range [0, 9] to every alphabet that occurs in the strings, such that the sum obtained after summing the numbers formed by encoding all strings in the array is equal to the number formed by the string S using Python. Input: arr[][] = {“SEND”, “MORE”},  S = “MONEY” Output: Yes explanation:  One of the possible ways is: Map the characters as the following, ‘S’? 9, ‘E’?5, ‘N’?6, ‘D’?7, ‘M’?1, ‘O’?0, ‘R’?8, ‘Y’?2.  Now, after encoding the strings “SEND”, “MORE”, and “MONEY”, modifies to 9567, 1085 and 10652 respectively.  Thus, the sum of the values of “SEND” and “MORE” is equal to (9567+1085 = 10652), which is equal to the value of the string “MONEY”.
5.	It's a river-crossing puzzle that involves three missionaries and three cannibals who need to cross a river from one side to another. The problem comes with certain constraints:  •	There is a boat that can carry at most two people at a time.  •	On either side of the river, if the number of cannibals ever exceeds the number of missionaries, the cannibals will eat the missionaries, and the mission will fail.  The goal is to find a series of moves that allow all the missionaries and cannibals to cross the river safely. Implement the scenario using Python
6.	Imagine you have a simple autonomous vacuum cleaner, which can move around in a grid-based environment. The grid is divided into cells, some of which are dirty, and some are clean. The vacuum cleaner can move in four directions: up, down, left, and right. Its primary task is to clean all the dirty cells while minimizing its movements.  Implement the above AI problem using python.
